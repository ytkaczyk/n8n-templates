## Automated image processing for e-commerce catalog

Template is available as an official n8n workflow at [Enhance Product Photos with Google Gemini AI for E-commerce Catalog](https://n8n.io/workflows/9390-enhance-product-photos-with-google-gemini-ai-for-e-commerce-catalog/). 

### Use cases 
* Monitor a Google Drive folder, process each image based on the prompt defined in `Workflow Configuration` and save the new image to the specified output Google Drive folder.
* Maintain a processing log in Google Sheets.

#### Examples
<table style="border: 0; boder-collapse: collapse; padding: 0;" >
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img alt="Flower vase" src="assets/flowers.jpg" width=250px  /></td>
      <td><img alt="" src="assets/ai-technology.png" /></td>
      <td><img alt="Fixed Flower vase" src="assets/flowers_clean.png" width=250px  /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img alt="Mug" src="assets/mug_2.jpg" width=250px  /></td>
      <td><img alt="" src="assets/ai-technology.png" /></td>
      <td><img alt="Fixed Mug" src="assets/mug_2_clean.png" width=250px  /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

üëç This use case can be extended to any scenario requiring batch image processing, for example, unifying the look and feel of team photos on a company website.


### How it works
* Trigger: Watches a Google Drive folder for new or updated files.
* Downloads the image, processes it using Google Gemini (Nano Banana), and uploads the new image to the specified output folder.


### How to use
* Google Drive and Google Sheets nodes:
  * Create Google credentials with access to Google Drive and Google Sheets. [Read more about Google Credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).
  * Update **all** Google Drive and Google Sheets nodes (6 nodes total) to use these credentials
* Gemini AI node:
  * Create Google Gemini(PaLM) Api credentials. [Read more about Google Gemini(PaLM) credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/googleai/).
  * Update the `Edit Image` node to use the Gemini Api credentials.
* Create a Google Sheets spreadsheet following the steps in `Google Sheets Configuration` (see right ‚û°Ô∏è). Ensure the spreadsheet can be accessed as `Editor` by the account used for the Google Credentials.
* Create input and output directories in Google Drive. Ensure these directories are accessible by the account used for the credentials.
* Update the `File Created`, `File Updated` and `Workflow Configuration` node following the steps in the green Notes (see right ‚û°Ô∏è).


### Requirements
* Google account with Google API access
* Google AI Studio account with ability to create a Google Gemini API key.
* Basic n8n knowledge: understanding of triggers, expressions, and credential management
